Design Inspiration
</h3>
        <h4>Welcome to Helena’s personal website! </h4>
The team wanted to create this separate entity to allow her to access entertainment all in one place through her Tobii. 
We also recognized how much of a challenge it is for Helena to be outside in the bright sunlight: the glare on her Tobii 
impacts how the eye-gaze technology functions. With the Tobii system being a hugely important aspect of Helena’s life, 
the design goal was to enable her to fully engage with the system, regardless of her environment.

Process
The team iterated through hours of ideas to identify a product concept that would be beneficial for Helena and her family, but that would be achievable within the timeframe. We saw need in the comfort of her wheelchair, ease of interaction with her friends and family, movement and freedom of expression, and support for her Tobii system.
