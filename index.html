Design Inspiration
</h3>
        <h4>Welcome to Helena’s personal website! </h4>
The team wanted to create this separate entity to allow her to access entertainment all in one place through her Tobii. 
We also recognized how much of a challenge it is for Helena to be outside in the bright sunlight: the glare on her Tobii 
impacts how the eye-gaze technology functions. With the Tobii system being a hugely important aspect of Helena’s life, 
the design goal was to enable her to fully engage with the system, regardless of her environment.

Process
</h3>
The team iterated through hours of ideas to identify a product concept that would be beneficial for Helena and her family, 
but that would be achievable within the timeframe. We saw need in the comfort of her wheelchair, ease of interaction with her
friends and family, movement and freedom of expression, and support for her Tobii system.

Concept
</h3><p>Originally, we ran with an idea of small speakers for Helena that would play personal music for her without the use of earbuds. After checking back with her and her family, it was determined that there were other ways to focus our resources and energy. We went back to the drawing board, brainstormed and sketched, and began to prototype.</p>

Acknowledgements
</h3><p>We wanted to thank you, Helena, and your family for giving us the opportunity to design for you! It was a wonderful challenge and we’re grateful to have met you and your family. We also like that you’re interested in science! If you ever want to talk about science with us or have ideas, we would be happy to hear them. Thanks, also, to Eleanor for visiting too!</p>
