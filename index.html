<p>Originally, we ran with an idea of small speakers for Helena that would play personal music for her without the use of earbuds. After checking back with her and her family, it was determined that there were other ways to focus our resources and energy. We went back to the drawing board, brainstormed and sketched, and began to prototype.</p>

<p>We wanted to thank you, Helena, and your family for giving us the opportunity to design for you! It was a wonderful challenge and we’re grateful to have met you and your family. We also like that you’re interested in science! If you ever want to talk about science with us or have ideas, we would be happy to hear them. Thanks, also, to Eleanor for visiting too!</p>
